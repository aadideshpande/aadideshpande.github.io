- Distributed microservices with Java (Spring Boot) and SQL solutions  
- Building and deploying applications on cloud platforms using Docker

I’m **actively seeking Summer 2025 internship** opportunities where I can apply my background in financial mathematics, quantitative analysis, and software development to solve real-world business challenges.

**Key Skills**  
- **Programming**: Python, C/C++, Java, SQL  
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Docker, FastAPI, Spring Boot
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Finance/Quant**: Portfolio Optimization, Risk Management, Machine Learning

## Projects

I’ve worked on various projects involving portfolio optimization, systematic credit investing, distributed systems, and data analytics. To learn more, visit my [Projects page](projects.md) (coming soon), or explore my GitHub repositories directly.
